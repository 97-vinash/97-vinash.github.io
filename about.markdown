# About Me

Hello! I'm **Avinash Shankar**, Currently pursuing my B.Tech Degree in CSE with specialization in Cybersecurity, I’ve just completed my second year of college,  
While I’ve gained a solid foundation in theory, I haven’t yet had the chance to work on many real-world projects applying that knowledge.
The first two years of my curriculum have focused mostly on core computer science concepts, with limited emphasis on practical cyber security skills.  
  
Through this Blog site i will document my learning journey, share my projects, and track my progress along the way.  

You can find my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/97-vinash) and Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/avinash-shankar-643809249/).

Thanks for visiting!
