Welcome to my blog! I’ve just completed my second year of college specializing in Cyber Security. While I’ve gained a solid foundation in theory, I haven’t yet had the chance to work on many real-world projects applying that knowledge. The first two years of my curriculum have focused mostly on core computer science concepts, with limited emphasis on practical cyber security skills.

Throughout this time, I found myself exploring different paths — sometimes guided by others, sometimes drawn by trending topics like AI, and other times concerned about job prospects and salaries. However, my curiosity about how things work under the hood has always been my driving force.

I’ve dabbled in Linux, computer organization, and networking, but often struggled to maintain consistency, stopping after a few days or weeks. This blog is my commitment to change that. My goal is to become a skilled Red Team Operator or Penetration Tester, and through this space, I will document my learning journey, share projects, and track my progress along the way.
