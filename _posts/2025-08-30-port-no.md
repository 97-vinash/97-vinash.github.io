excerpt: An IP address gets data to the correct computer, but then the port number tells the data which specific application/service to go in. For example it ensures a video stream from YouTube is handled by your web browser on a port like 443, instead of getting incorrectly sent to your email client. This simple but vital system allows dozens of programs to share a single network connection without ever mixing up their messages. And even if we don't use internet, we still need Port numbers!

# Port Numbers 

**What Exactly Are Port Numbers?**  
Port numbers are essentially **just addresses for services** or applications **running on a device.** They are combined with the IP addresses eg: 192.168.10.2:8080

**Why Do We Even Need Port Numbers?**  
We all know that **IP addresses** are used so one computer can find another computer across a network. But what after that ?
For Example let's say you open your browser, navigate to YouTube, and search for a video. Here's what happens:  

1. Your request goes to YouTube's server
2. The server fetches the video data
3. The data comes back to your PC **using your IP address**

But now, **Where should this video data go once it reaches your PC?**

- Should it go to your **mail box**? Obviously not!
- It should go to your **YouTube webpage** in the browser

But how does the incoming data know where to go?  
To your mail box (OR) to your YouTube page?  
**That's where port numbers come in!**  
They tell the data to go to:
- **Port 443** (HTTPS) for your web browser

**So, If I don't connect to Internet at all. Would Port Numbers still be of any use ?**  
YES they still be useful.  
  
**I am not getting any data from the internet, so it doesn't need to find any services on my device then Why?**  
It's Because Your computer uses something called **loopback communication** to talk to itself. When two or more services inside your computer need to share data, they communicate by sending information to each other's designated ports.

**Example: Local Web Development**  
Most of us have at least once in our life hosted a simple HTML website locally when learning web development. To see how it looks, we deploy it locally.  
Remember this familiar sight: `localhost:8000` OR `localhost:8080`  
Since `localhost` can be written as `127.0.0.1`, this becomes: `127.0.0.1:8000`  

**So, What's happening here?**
- We're deploying our site locally on `127.0.0.1:8000`
- Our webpage is **listening** on **port 8000**
- When we open our web browser and type `127.0.0.1:8000`, the browser connects to that port (8000) and shows our website

**Remember:** This all happens **locally without internet**, so we still need port numbers even without an internet connection!

## Key Takeaways

- **Port numbers** act as specific addresses for services running on a device.
- They work alongside **IP addresses** to ensure data reaches the correct application.
- Port numbers are essential for both **network communication** and **local services**
- Even without internet, your computer uses ports for **internal communication** between services.
- Common ports include:-  
**Port 22** SSH / **Port 25** SMTP / **Port 53** DNS / **Port 80** HTTP / **Port 443** HTTPS  
- Port numbers range from 0 to 65535  
Well-Known Ports (0–1023)  
Registered Ports (1024–49151)  
Dynamic/Private Ports (49152–65535)  
- Any port can technically be used for any service, and running standard services on non-default ports—such as HTTP on port 22—is considered unusual but it is possible.
