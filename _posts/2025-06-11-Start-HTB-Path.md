## Context

This post is about me starting a new journey in HTB and starting my first path: **Information Security Foundation**.  
I wrote this blog to clearly state what I learned through this and what are important things in the first 2 modules.  
In this specific post, I’m not going to discuss any technical aspects, because I’ve only completed the first 2 modules, and they are mainly focused on how to think/manage/understand your thoughts as a cybersecurity learner — and not giving up and being persistent.

## Quick Notes

**Module 1 – Intro to Academy**  
It just tells the main terminologies that are used in HTB Academy — things like **Path**, **Modules**, **Sections**, etc. There's nothing much to explain here.

**Module 2 – Learning Process**  
The second module has some important concepts/topics — maybe not very important for other people — But I think it's also useful in the sense that it gives you an idea of how simple things like decision-making, setting a goal, or fear of something, can be put in a very logically explained way, according to psychology and research.  
It can give you direction on how to think clearly, and how to think logically and differently — and to keep going and push your limits to get out of your comfort zone.  
*(Yes, I did read the whole thing line by line, word by word, and it was so much info to take in. I also added it to favourites to look it up when I don't feel motivated or feel low.)*

## Key Takeaways (according to me)

- Try to think outside the box.  
- Try to search for the most easy solution first.  
- Talent is not something someone is born with — you develop it by training yourself.  
- Define your goal clearly. *(very important)*  
- Apply what you learn. *(very important)*  
- Comfort Zone. *(Recommended to read the whole section)*  
- Children do not fear to explore and they also don't overcomplicate things like adults do. They also don’t fear failure — that's why they learn fast. Because they don't have that imaginary fear of failure — the "what if I fail" mindset.  
- Questioning. *(Read the whole ROQ model)*  
- Frustration is temporary. This means that when we feel frustrated, it will pass — don't panic or overreact. Take a deep breath and think about it for a sec.  
- Search for some sample Penetration Testing Reports/Documents to get familiar with it. *(Recommended)*

## What’s Next?

- Continue the next modules 3-4.  
- Take short notes only for things that looked interesting or useful.  
- Start exploring terminal commands.
